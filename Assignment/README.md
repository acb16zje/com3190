**Assignment: Simulating Chemistry:** 87 / 100

1. Only acceptable intermediates are used but not all acceptable intermediates are used which
   suggests an innacurate model. Good use of parallel composition to fix the model. You say that the
   HCO is an acceptable intermediate but define it as COH. I think these are equivalent but be
   careful with this sort of thing...
   
2. Nice use of processes to simulate molecules. Very nice intermediate reaction printing. Nicely
   documented code. Nice use of specs and types and some good eunit tests.
